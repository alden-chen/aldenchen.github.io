title: The Curse of Knowledge

September 12, 2018

   We often find it challenging to imagine what it's like to *not* know what we already know. This can become problematic when we communicate with others. We incorrectly assume others share the same knowledge and background as us when we communicate with them, leaving them confused. In other words, we find it difficult to share the knowledge we already have. This phenomenon is a coginitive bias called "the curse of knowledge," a term originally coined by behavioural economists. The curse of knowledge has wide-ranging consequences in various facets of life, ranging from business to education to healthcare. There are, however, several strategies that help combat the curse of knowledge. One important strategy is to tell stories or give concrete examples instead of using abstract ideas or concepts. When people can attach our ideas to real stories and concrete language, they often understand our ideas better.
